Steps to use Redux and Redux-Toolkit

1. First make the Store - single source of truth
   use to configure Store import configureStore and make it aware about all the reducer

2. Make the Slice file where reducers(features) are define using createSlice
   to create slice 3 things are required a. name, b. InitialState c. reducers which take object as key-function pairs
   In the functions you have access of two things i.e. state and action
   in state you get - upated state value in the store
   in action you get - payload (data) \*there are many things you can get from action but payload is imp here
